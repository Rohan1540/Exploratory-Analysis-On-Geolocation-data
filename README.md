# Exploratory-Analysis-On-Geolocation-data
This project involves the use of K-Means Clustering to find the best accommodation for students in Hyderabad by classifying accommodation for incoming students on the basis of their preferences on amenities, budget and proximity to the location.

The Project has different stages which are mentioned in the flow diagram below:

The Approach for creation of the project would be as follows:
• Fetch Datasets from the relevant locations (Data Collection)
• Clean the Datasets to prepare them for analysis. (Data Cleaning via Pandas)
• Visualise the data using boxplots. (Using Matplotlib /Seaborn /Pandas)
• Fetch Geolocational Data from the Foursquare API. (REST APIs)
• Use K-Means Clustering to cluster the locations (Using ScikitLearn)
• Present findings on a map. (Using Folium/Seaborn)

Out of 70 different Columns selecting the most necessary data columns required for the analysis

A Box-plot graph can be helpful to look at distributed groups. It can tell us at glance where the population is concentrated, and how the outliers are as compare to the average object in the group.
